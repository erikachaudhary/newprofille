          <p class="card-text" "lh-1">Who is Erika Chaudhary? 

            I grew up in a small town in Kupiskis, Lithuania. 
            I went to a boarding art school. I love arts. I have always been a creative at heart. 
            I have studied English Literature at a University of London and absolutely loved it. 
            I love reading and writing. I was very sad when my degree ended.</p>
            
            <p class="lh-sm"> My career. 
            
            I have worked in Marketing for many years. I have worked for large organisations such as Samsung
            and I have worked for small organisations and agencies such as We Are Xpert Ltd and Mytabsapp. 
            I got myself a MSc Marketing diploma from a University of London because I thought it would help my marketing career.</p>
            
            <p class="lh-base"> I later discovered that my true artistic side comes out creating websites. Yes, creating websites is super creative.
            It is like creating a painting. I start with just an idea then slowly develop it into something beautiful (one hopes)! 
            I am now working as a web developer and I absolutely love it. If you would like a website 
            let me know. We can have chat. </p>
